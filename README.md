# Pomodoro_Timer_Program
Pomodoro is a time-management technique where a person times themselves for 25 minutes to completely focus on a task.  After the 25 is up, the person takes a 5 minute break. A complete cycle of a 25 minute timed focus and 5 minute great is called a Pomodoro. After 4 Pomodoros, the person gets a long break of 20 minutes.

---How the Program Works---

Once the program loads, there will be a "start" and "reset" button. The start button will begin the timer. The timer **cannot** be paused. The reason for this is to push users to stick to 25 minutes straight of focus. After the timer completes, the user will get a 5 minute break. After four cycles of 25min work and 5min breaks (A **pomodoro**), the user will get a **long break of 20 minutes.**
