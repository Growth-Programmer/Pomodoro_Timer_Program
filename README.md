Pomodoro is a time-management technique where a person times themselves for 25 minutes to completely focus on a task.  After the 25 is up, the person takes a 5 minute break. A complete cycle of a 25 minute timed focus and 5 minute great is called a Pomodoro. After 4 Pomodoros, the person gets a long break of 20 minutes.
